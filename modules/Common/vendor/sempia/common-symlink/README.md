Common Symlink (Composer plugin)
================================

[Common Symlink] is a Composer plugin that creates a symlink for the [Omeka S]
module [Common], ensuring backward compatibility with older modules.

This plugin is needed exclusively for this usage. It is useless anywhere else.


Installation
------------

This plugin is installed automatically as a dependency of [Common]. It is
useless anywhere else.


Using Common as a dependency in a module
----------------------------------------

Once the [pull request #2412] will be merged, any omeka module will be able to
use Common as a dependency in a standard way, with the package `daniel-km/omeka-s-module-common`
under key `require`. Then a simple `use Common\TraitModule;` in Module.php will
be enough to include it.

Currently, many older Omeka S modules depend on Common root-level files via
`require_once` (see below, still supported).

When Common is installed via Composer to `composer-addons/modules/Common/`, this
path doesn't resolve. So this composer plugin creates a symlink `modules/Common`
pointing to `composer-addons/modules/Common`, ensuring these older modules
continue to work.

### Recommended (PSR-4 autoloading)

Modules should use standard PSR-4 autoloading instead of `require_once`, so they
must require the module Common in their own composer.json:

```sh
composer require daniel-km/omeka-s-module-common
```

Then, in Module.php:

```php
<?php declare(strict_types=1);

namespace MyModule;

use Common\TraitModule;
use Omeka\Module\AbstractModule;

class Module extends AbstractModule
{
    use TraitModule;

    const NAMESPACE = __NAMESPACE__;
}
```

Available classes:
- `Common\AbstractModule` - Old base class for modules (deprecated)
- `Common\TraitModule` - Trait with common module functionality
- `Common\ManageModuleAndResources` - Helper for resource installation

### Legacy (deprecated)

Old modules using `require_once` will continue to work thanks to the symlink:

```php
// Still works but not recommended, with or without the subdirectory src/.
require_once dirname(__DIR__) . '/Common/src/TraitModule.php';
```


How it works
------------

The plugin subscribes to Composer `post-package-install` and `post-package-update`
events and create or delete the symlink in directory Common. When `modules/Common`
already exists as a real directory (local override), the symlink is not created.

| Event                  | Action                                           |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Common installed       | Create symlink `modules/Common`                  |
| Common updated         | Update symlink if target changed                 |
| Common uninstalled     | Remove symlink                                   |
| `modules/Common` exists| Skip symlink (local directory takes precedence)  |


Warning
-------

Use it at your own risk.

It's always recommended to backup your files and your databases and to check
your archives regularly so you can roll back if needed.


Troubleshooting
---------------

See online issues on the [plugin issues] page on GitLab.

### Symlink not created

- Ensure the `modules/` directory is writeable
- Check if `modules/Common` already exists as a directory (local override)
- Verify Common is installed: `composer show daniel-km/omeka-s-module-common`

### Permission denied

Ensure the web server user has write access to the `modules/` directory.
