External Assets (Composer plugin)
=================================

[External Assets] is a Composer plugin that allows to download external assets
(JS, CSS, fonts, images, etc.) for any PHP project.

PHP projects often need external JavaScript or CSS libraries (jQuery plugins,
Mirador, OpenSeadragon, Leaflet, etc.). These assets are typically hosted on
CDNs or GitHub releases.

The issue is that composer `repositories` key is not inherited from
dependencies. If your package defines a custom repository for a JS library,
composer won't see it when users install your package. This plugin solves the
problem by downloading assets defined in `extra.external-assets` after your
package is installed, bypassing the repository inheritance limitation. Assets
are downloaded directly from their source URLs.

This is a lightweight solution. For more features, consider [civicrm/composer-downloads-plugin],
that has more options (variables, ignore patterns, executable flag), or any
other similar package of your choice.


Installation
------------

Add to your package `composer.json`:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "sempia/external-assets": "^1.0"
    }
}
```

When users install your package via composer, assets are downloaded
automatically.


Usage
-----

Define assets in `extra.external-assets` in your package `composer.json`:

```json
{
    "extra": {
        "external-assets": {
            "asset/vendor/mirador/": "https://github.com/ProjectMirador/mirador/releases/download/v3.3.0/mirador.zip",
            "asset/vendor/lib/jquery.autocomplete.min.js": "https://cdn.example.com/jquery.autocomplete-1.5.0.min.js"
        }
    }
}
```

The key is the destination path (relative to your package directory), the value
is the source URL.

| Destination         | URL                     | Behavior                         |
|---------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `path/to/file.js`   | `https://.../lib.js`    | Download and rename to `file.js` |
| `path/to/dir/`      | `https://.../lib.zip`   | Extract archive into `dir/`      |
| `path/to/dir/`      | `https://.../script.js` | Copy `script.js` into `dir/`     |

Rules:

1. **File destination** (no trailing `/`): Downloads and saves with the
   specified filename.

2. **Directory + archive** (trailing `/` + `.zip`/`.tar.gz`/`.tgz`): Extracts
   the archive. If it contains a single root directory, it is stripped.

3. **Directory + file** (trailing `/` + non-archive URL): Copies the file into
   the directory, keeping its original name.

### Complete example

```json
{
    "name": "your-vendor/your-package",
    "type": "library",
    "require": {
        "sempia/external-assets": "^1.0"
    },
    "autoload": {
        "psr-4": {
            "YourPackage\\": "src/"
        }
    },
    "extra": {
        "external-assets": {
            "asset/vendor/openseadragon/": "https://github.com/openseadragon/openseadragon/releases/download/v4.1.0/openseadragon-bin-4.1.0.zip",
            "asset/vendor/leaflet/": "https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.4/dist/leaflet.zip",
            "asset/vendor/js/helper.min.js": "https://cdn.example.com/helper-2.0.min.js"
        }
    }
}
```

### Cli tool for manual installations

For packages installed via `git clone`, assets are not downloaded automatically.
Use the cli tool:

```sh
# From project root directory
php vendor/bin/external-assets /path/to/package

# Force re-download
php vendor/bin/external-assets --force /path/to/package

# Multiple packages
php vendor/bin/external-assets /path/to/package1 /path/to/package2
```

| Option    | Description                                   |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `--force` | Re-download assets even if they already exist |
| `--help`  | Show usage information                        |

### Best practices

1. Use versioned release URLs instead of `main`/`master` branch links.

2. Always use HTTPS URLs for security.

3. Organize assets under `asset/vendor/` with a consistent structure.

4. Add to `.gitignore`:
   ```gitignore
   /asset/vendor/
   ```

5. Test both installation methods: `composer require` and `git clone`.


How it works
------------

The plugin subscribes to four composer events:

- **`post-package-install`** and **`post-package-update`**: download assets when
  a package is first installed or updated.

- **`post-install-cmd`** and **`post-update-cmd`**: after every `composer install`
  or `composer update`, check for missing assets across all packages (including
  the root package) and download them. This ensures assets are restored if
  deleted, and handles the root package whose assets are not covered by
  per-package events.

For each asset, the plugin downloads the file and either saves it directly,
extracts it (for archives), or copies it into the target directory. Assets that
already exist are skipped (idempotent).


Requirements
------------

| Requirement             | Version  |
|-------------------------|----------|
| PHP                     | 7.2.5+   |
| Composer                | 2.0+     |
| `unzip` or `ZipArchive` | Any      |
| `tar` or `PharData`     | Any      |


Development
-----------

### Running tests

```sh
# Unit tests only
vendor/bin/phpunit --exclude-group integration

# All tests (unit + integration)
PROJECT_PATH=/path/to/project vendor/bin/phpunit
```

The `PROJECT_PATH` environment variable should point to any valid directory (e.g.,
the project where the plugin is installed). Integration tests use this path to
verify the plugin can be loaded in a real environment.


Warning
-------

Use it at your own risk.

It's always recommended to backup your files and your databases and to check
your archives regularly so you can roll back if needed.


Troubleshooting
---------------

See online issues on the [plugin issues] page on GitLab.

### Assets not downloading

- Ensure your package requires `sempia/external-assets`
- Verify URLs are accessible: `curl -I https://your-url.com/file.js`
- Check that the package directory is writeable

### Archive extraction fails

The plugin uses `unzip`/`ZipArchive` for `.zip` and `tar`/`PharData` for
`.tar.gz`. Ensure at least one method is available.

### Assets outdated

Use `--force` to re-download:

```sh
php vendor/bin/external-assets --force /path/to/package
```
